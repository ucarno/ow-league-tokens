## Command line arguments
Program can be started without menu using `python main.py nomenu`. But to do this you need to
configure program using menu or use arguments.

### Arguments
Arguments can be used only when starting program using `nomenu` command:
* `--owl` | `--no-owl` - either earn OWL Tokens or not - default is config value or `true` if not specified
* `--owc` | `--no-owc` - either earn Contenders Skins or not - default is config value or `true` if not specified
* `--ids` - list of integer IDs that will be used instead of IDs from config
(you can get your ID from this API: https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/search/account-by-name/username/) or [manually](#manually-getting-your-account-id).

### Examples
* `python main.py nomenu --owl --no-owc` - earn OWL Tokens, do not earn Contenders Skins, IDs from config
* `python main.py nomenu --ids 1234 4567 8910` - `owl` and `owc` values from config, IDs from command line

### Manually getting your account ID
* The official Overwatch League website is storing account ID in a cookie named `account_id`. 
To get cookie's value, follow these steps:
1. Go to [https://overwatchleague.com/en-us](https://overwatchleague.com/en-us) and login using your Battle.net account
2. Open your browser's development tools (usually CTRL + Shift + I)
3. Depending on your browser, use one of the following options:
   * Chrome: Go to the Application tab -> Cookies -> `https://overwatchleague.com` -> Name: account_id
   * Firefox: Go to the Storage tab -> Cookies -> `https://overwatchleague.com` -> Name: account_id

## Docker
This application supports Docker! You can either build it by using the supplied `docker-compose.yml` or `Dockerfile`!
To use it, just clone this repository to your Docker Host.

### Docker Compose (recommended way if using Docker)
1. Make sure Docker Compose is installed on your machine! More info here: [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
2. Edit `docker-compose.yml` to include your IDs! Remove `owl`/`owc` options if needed (see [above](#arguments)).
3. `docker compose up -d` - the container is built by [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) using the Dockerfile.
   * `docker compose ps` to verify if container is running!
   * `docker compose logs -f` to view container's logs.

### Dockerfile
1. Edit Dockerfile to include your IDs. Remove `owl`/`owc` options if needed (see [above](#arguments)).
2. `docker build -t ow-league-tokens .` to build container using the Dockerfile. 
3. `docker run -d ow-league-tokens:latest` to start new container using the image.
   * `docker container ls` to check if container is running
   * `docker logs ow-league-tokens` to view container's logs

## Troubleshooting
1. In case the program wont launch (The console close itself instantly after executing main.py or builded .exe), it can maybe due to missing dependencies.
   To fix this error, do to .scripts folder and execute the install dependencies.cmd file and test again.
